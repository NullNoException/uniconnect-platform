## 3. Modular System Architecture

I recommend a modular microservices architecture for scalability and maintainability:

### Architecture Components

1. **API Gateway Layer**

   - Handles authentication, request routing, and API rate limiting
   - Implemented with Azure API Management or AWS API Gateway

2. **Core Microservices**

   - User Service: Authentication, profiles, permissions
   - Service Catalog: Listings, search, categorization
   - Document Service: Secure storage, sharing, processing
   - Communication Service: Messaging, notifications
   - Payment Service: Processing, escrow management
   - Review Service: Ratings, feedback management
   - Reporting Service: Analytics, status tracking

3. **Cross-Cutting Concerns**

   - Logging and monitoring
   - Distributed caching
   - Event bus for service communication
   - Identity and access management

4. **Client Applications**
   - Web application (React SPA or Blazor WASM)
   - Mobile applications (native or cross-platform)
   - Admin portals

### Integration Patterns

- REST APIs for synchronous operations
- Message queue (Azure Service Bus/AWS SQS) for asynchronous processing
- Event-driven architecture for service-to-service communication
- BFF (Backend for Frontend) pattern for optimized client experiences

## 4. Key Databases and Entities

### Database Recommendations

- Primary operational data: SQL database (Azure SQL/AWS RDS)
- Document storage: Blob storage (Azure Blob Storage/AWS S3)
- Caching: Redis
- Search functionality: Elasticsearch
- Analytics data: Data warehouse (Azure Synapse/AWS Redshift)
