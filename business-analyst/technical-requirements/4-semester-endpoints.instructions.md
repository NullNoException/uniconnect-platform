🗓️ Semester Management
🔹 Academic Calendar Configuration
"Design a system for configuring academic calendars for universities. Allow admins to define academic years, semester periods, breaks, and holidays. Calendars should support custom configurations per university and align with regional academic structures."

🔹 Semester Creation and Management
"Enable the creation and management of semesters under each academic calendar. Semesters should include a title (e.g., Fall 2025), start and end dates, associated academic year, and linked programs. Allow status tracking such as Active, Upcoming, or Completed."

🔹 Application Deadline Tracking
"Implement deadline management for each semester. Allow configuration of key deadlines such as application opening, submission deadline, and enrollment confirmation date. Include reminders and alerts for upcoming or overdue deadlines."

🔹 Semester Status Management (Active/Inactive/Upcoming)
"Create logic to manage semester lifecycle statuses: Upcoming (not started), Active (in progress), and Inactive or Past (finished or archived). Use dates to auto-transition status when possible and allow manual overrides with admin control."

🔹 Academic Year Organization
"Allow universities to organize semesters under academic years. Each academic year should have a label (e.g., 2025–2026), a start and end date, and a list of included semesters. Ensure consistency across calendars and provide a hierarchical display."

🔹 Cross-University Semester Alignment
"Build tools to compare or align semesters across multiple universities. Identify semester overlaps or misalignments. Provide admins with views or reports showing semester timelines across different institutions for synchronization or coordination."

🔹 Excel Data Import/Export Engine
"Create a flexible engine for importing and exporting university and program data using Excel files. Users should be able to download pre-formatted templates, populate them, and upload the files. Include status messages, upload history, and retry options."

🔹 Data Validation and Error Reporting
"Add robust data validation when importing Excel files. Highlight invalid or missing fields, show row-specific error messages, and allow users to download an error report. Prevent invalid data from being saved and provide clear guidance on corrections."

🔹 University Data Synchronization
"Implement data synchronization between external university data sources and the platform. Ensure the system can pull or push updates such as program listings, tuition changes, or contact details. Include options for manual or scheduled syncs."

🔹 Program Catalog Standardization
"Build a system to standardize academic program data across universities. Ensure consistent naming conventions, levels, disciplines, and format across the catalog. Use rules or mappings to correct variations and unify terminology."

🔹 Tuition Fee and Currency Conversion
"Add functionality to support tuition fee conversion between different currencies. Use real-time or scheduled exchange rates to display equivalent fees in multiple currencies. Allow fees to be stored in original currency and shown in user-preferred currency."
