UniConnect Platform: Detailed Description
The UniConnect platform is an educational services marketplace designed to connect university students with various educational support providers. It aims to streamline the process of finding, engaging, and managing educational services, while also providing a robust administrative interface for platform management and a dedicated portal for service providers.

Core Objectives:

Student Empowerment: Provide students with easy access to a wide range of educational services, including application assistance, document translation, scholarship application support, and more.

Provider Growth: Enable educational consultancies and independent brokers to expand their client base, manage services, and streamline payment collection.

Efficient Administration: Offer a comprehensive admin panel for platform administrators to oversee all operations, including user management, content moderation, financial reporting, and system configuration.

Seamless Transactions: Facilitate secure and efficient payment processing, including escrow management, invoicing, and payouts.
